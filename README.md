# PhotoPi
This is another python/Raspberry Pi photobooth :)

It work's with standard Raspbian image.

My hardware :
- Raspberry pi 2 or 3 (not tested on another version, but everything should be fine)
- Canon Rebel T2i Camera (550d in Europe), with AC adapter (or any other DSLR recognize by Gphoto2)
- an old 17' vga monitor
- old PC speakers
- 2 big dome buttons :)
- a DIY wood box to put everything in

Quick information on how to use it :
- just launch ./go.sh (with local or distant terminal)
- use spacebar, left mouse button or GPIO switch (default pin #32) for action 1
- use return key, right mouse button or GPIO switch (default pin #36) for action 2
- type Escape or Q to quit
